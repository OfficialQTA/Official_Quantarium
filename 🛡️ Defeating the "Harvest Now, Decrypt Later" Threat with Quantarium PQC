The Problem: Harvesting Today for Decryption Tomorrow
Traditional cryptographic standards like RSA and ECDSA are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm. While fault-tolerant quantum computers are still evolving, threat actors are currently archiving encrypted traffic (HNDL strategy). This means today's "secure" data is effectively a ticking time bomb.

The Solution: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Mainnet
Quantarium is engineered to provide Forward Security by integrating NIST-standardized PQC algorithms directly into the protocol layer.

Algorithms: Implementation of ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium) to ensure quantum-resistant key encapsulation and digital signatures.

Infrastructure: A commercially available L1 Mainnet that allows for no-code asset issuance with native PQC security.

Use Case: Ideal for long-term data integrity, secure messaging (SECURET), and future-proof digital asset management.

Technical Deep Dive
Quantarium doesn't just promise future security; it defuses the HNDL threat by making intercepted data computationally infeasible to decrypt, even for future quantum adversaries.
